As part of Georgia Tech's Online Master's of Science in Analytics, under a course titled CSE6242 Data and Visual Analytics (https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2020spring-online/) during the Spring 2020 semester, team 26 set out to explore the potential influence of social media on event outcomes. For the project, the team focused on the 2016 US Presidential Elections for experiments and model-building, using a dataset of 10 million tweet ids captured by Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PDI7IN) which were then hydrated to retrieve the complete tweets. Sentiment analysis was then conducted on tweet content, including the usage of emojis. The results of the experiments and models for 5 key events are then communicated through interactive visualizations with a visually-appealing web interface for ease of access and understanding.
